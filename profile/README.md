🚀 **Introduction and Mission**

Lybic provides a cutting-edge infrastructure solution for AI agents. Through our cloud-based sandbox environments (including virtual computers, mobile devices, and containers), we offer **out-of-the-box GUI operation capabilities**. This infrastructure, accessible via standard MCP, SDKs, and RESTful APIs, resolves critical challenges in GUI interaction, resource hosting, and high-concurrency execution.

Our self-developed **Grounding Inference Framework** empowers agents not just to "operate" interface elements, but to truly "understand" screen content, enabling autonomous decision-making in complex digital environments. Our mission is to provide the foundational tools that allow developers to focus on building intelligent agents, not on the underlying infrastructure.
